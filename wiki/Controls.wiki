White Bomber: WASD to move and SPACE to bomb.
Black Bomber: IJKL to move and SEMI-COLON to bomb.

ESCAPE to leave the game, or exit the game from the menu.

No current controls for red/blue bomber, but those will be implemented once 
support for control-swapping in game is added. For now, there is no point since most
people will not use the same control scheme for all the bombers.
